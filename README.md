# SE-Assignment-6
 Assignment: Introduction to Python
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of Python programming. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

 ANSWERS

1)Python is a versatile, high-level programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and extensive libraries, making it popular for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and automation tasks.

2) Installing Python:
Windows:

Download Python Installer:

Visit the official Python website: python.org.
Navigate to the Downloads section and choose the latest Python release suitable for Windows.
Download the installer (e.g., Windows installer (exe)).
Run the Installer:

Once the download completes, run the installer.
Check the box that says "Add Python to PATH" during the installation process.
Click "Install Now" to begin the installation.
Verify Installation:

Open Command Prompt (cmd.exe).
Type python --version to check that Python is installed and accessible from the command line.
Type pip --version to verify that pip (Python's package installer) is also installed.
Set Up a Virtual Environment:

Open Command Prompt and navigate to your project directory.
Install virtualenv using pip if not already installed: pip install virtualenv.

3) print("Hello, World!")

4)Python supports several fundamental data types: integers (int) for whole numbers like -5, floats (float) for decimal numbers such as 3.14, strings (str) for sequences of characters like "hello", booleans (bool) representing True or False values, and NoneType (None) indicating the absence of a value. In Python, variables are dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to explicitly declare a variable's type. Here's a short example script demonstrating these data types:

python

# Creating variables of different data types
x = 10          # integer
y = 3.14        # float
name = "Alice"  # string
is_valid = True # boolean
none_value = None # NoneType

# Printing variables and their types
print("x:", x, type(x))
print("y:", y, type(y))
print("name:", name, type(name))
print("is_valid:", is_valid, type(is_valid))
print("none_value:", none_value, type(none_value))
This script defines variables x, y, name, is_valid, and none_value with respective data types (int, float, str, bool, NoneType), prints each variable along with its type, showcasing Python's dynamic typing and straightforward syntax for working with different types of data.

5)  In Python, conditional statements and loops are essential control structures that enable programmers to control the flow of execution based on conditions and to iterate over sequences of data, respectively. Conditional statements, like the if-else statement, allow you to execute certain blocks of code conditionally. For instance, if condition: executes a block of code if the condition is true, while else: executes an alternative block if the condition is false. Here's an example:

python

# Example of an if-else statement
x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
else:
    print("x is not greater than 5")
This code snippet checks if x is greater than 5 and prints the corresponding message based on the evaluation of the condition. Loops, such as the for loop, enable you to iterate over sequences like lists or ranges. For example:

python
# Example of a for loop
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
In this loop, range(5) generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to 4 (exclusive), and for i in range(5): iterates over each number in the sequence, printing it to the console. These control structures provide flexibility and efficiency in managing program logic and handling repetitive tasks in Python.

6) Functions in Python are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks, encapsulating logic to enhance code organization and reusability; here's an example:

python

# Python function to calculate the sum of two numbers
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

# Example of calling the function
result = add_numbers(3, 5)
print("Sum:", result)  # Output: Sum: 8
In this example, add_numbers is a function that takes two arguments (a and b), computes their sum using the + operator, and returns the result. When called with add_numbers(3, 5), it returns 8, which is then printed to the console. Functions help simplify code, promote code reuse, and improve maintainability in Python programming.

7) Lists in Python are ordered collections of elements accessed by index, while dictionaries are unordered collections accessed by keys for mapping key-value pairs.

8) Exception handling in Python is a mechanism to manage and respond to errors that occur during program execution; for example:

python

# Example of using try, except, and finally blocks
try:
    x = 10 / 0  # This will raise a ZeroDivisionError
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Error: Division by zero!")
finally:
    print("Cleanup or final statements")

9) Modules in Python are individual files containing reusable code, while packages are directories of modules with an __init__.py file, both imported using import to access their functionality, such as the math module for mathematical operations.
10) File I/O in Python involves reading and writing data to/from files using open() with modes like 'r' for reading or 'w' for writing, demonstrated by reading a file's content and printing it, and writing a list of strings to a file for persistence.
